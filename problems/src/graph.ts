/**
 *
 Problem:
 You are given a class GraphNode that represents a node in a binary search tree (BST).
 Each node has:
 A value
 A left child (left)
 A right child (right)

 The method addIfNotExists(node: GraphNode) is supposed to:

 Insert node into the correct position in the BST according to the rules:

 - All nodes in the left subtree is less than the current node's value.
 - All nodes in the right subtree is greater than the current node's value.
 - Ignore insertion if a node with the same value already exists anywhere in the tree.

 The twist:
 The method addIfNotExists is already implemented, but there is a bug.

 Your task is to find the bug, explain why it happens, and fix it so the method works correctly.

 Constraints: Obviouslly, no AI
